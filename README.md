# RN-clicker
React Native clicker app for code_exp training workshop. It's in dark mode because I like dark mode.

## Credits

I used the [Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) colors because they look nice and also allow me to make the Count(er) Dracula joke.

Partly based on [Thinkerpal's clicker](https://snack.expo.io/@thinkerpal/more-chocolates).
